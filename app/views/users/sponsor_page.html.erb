                               This info helps classify us the applicant's show into 'Rookie', 'Independent' or 'Major'. We then contact a Streamer with a similar amount of followers with the goal of at least doubling the total viewership for the event. For example, a student graduate show would be streamed and in most cases commentated by a rookie Streamer of around 1000 followers. A collective or a more established designer's show with a combined following of 5000 will be hosted (and ideally commentated) by an independent Streamer who also has around 5000 followers.  The classification system means small, medium and large firms can find the ideal show to sponsor.
