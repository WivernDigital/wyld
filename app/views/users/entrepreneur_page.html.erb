                Where possible, they will commentate on site and interview designers during breaks.

                hope to allow remote commentating so that more than one blogger/website can host in other

                languages.

                The event is streamed, reaching new and existing customers for the creatives, hosts and

                sponsors.
                <div class="text-section-break"></div>
                The streaming service is offered free to shows that successfully acquire a sponsor. We will

                provide a two man technician crew plus a host where appropriate, and ensure the stream

                flows uninterrupted (99% uptime) for the duration of the show. 
                <br>
                We have no fixed price for

                the packages. Simply send an email notifying us of the plan you would be interested in and

                your highest bid. This is a closed bid and after one week we will notify the winner/s.
                <div class="text-section-break"></div>

                <strong>Here is how the sponsorship payment is split:</strong>
                <br>
                25% to Event organisers
                <br>
                75% to Wyld (production crew, administration service and blogger/web magazine payouts)
                <div class="text-section-break"></div>
                Note that depending on the video platform the blogger operates on, they may need to pay

                the platform a product placement fee. For example, Youtube may request a 45% product

                placement fee. The blogger deducts this from their allotment of the sponsorship fee award to

                them by Wyld.
